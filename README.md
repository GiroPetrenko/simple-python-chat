# Simple python chat

This is a simple python chat program, made up with a client and a server.

 **Features:**
 1. Authentication
 2. Hash
 
Authentication:

This program have a simple AES authentication, with a user configured password. How does it works?
> Server send the client some random string (Not very random, generated by hash function)
> The client encrypts the string and send it back.
> Server checks the encrypted string.
> If correct, the connection will be established.

The passphrase that encrypt packages is the same for authentication.
